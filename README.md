**deneggs is a package developed in the department of prevention and control of diseases transmitted by vector of the [Secretary of Health of Veracruz](https://www.ssaver.gob.mx/) and with Authorization of the federal level***


## **overview**

**deneggs** is a package to generate predictive maps of the number of eggs or adults in areas where it is not collected.The predictive maps are generated using geostatistical analysis in the [INLA](http://www.r-inla.org/) framework. 

  - **`spde_pred_map()`** generate the predictive map.
  - **`eggs_map()`** generates an entomological risk map or an egg density map.
  - **`loc_grid_points()`** It is a complementary function that helps in the creation of grid of the locality in the prediction stack in [INLA](http://www.r-inla.org/).
  - **`mesh()`** It is a complementary function that helps in the creation of mesh.

The **deneggs** package was developed by the [CENAPRECE](https://www.gob.mx/salud/cenaprece) dengue prevention and control program in collaboration with [INDRE](https://www.gob.mx/salud/acciones-y-programas/instituto-de-diagnostico-y-referencia-epidemiologicos-mision-vision-y-politica-de-calidad-181639?state=published) (Entomology Laboratory), [INSP](https://www.insp.mx) (Health Systems Research Center & Population Health Research Center), and the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, and Yucatan.


## **Overview**

The **deneggs** package was designed to generate predictive maps of the number of eggs or adults through geostatistical analysis using stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) and integrated nested Laplace with [R-INLA](http://www.r-inla.org/). The objective of geostatistical analysis is to predict the response variable (eggs or adults) in areas or zones where entomological collection was not carried out, such as unsampled blocks.

Geostatistical analysis of entomological surveillance with ovitraps and adult collections was performed using the **deneggs** package. The package is part of dengueverse and has three functions for predicting the number of eggs in areas where they were not collected from a location.

- **`spde_pred_map`**

- **`eggs_hotspots`**

- **`eggs_hotspots_week`**

The spde_pred_map function performs geostatistical analysis per week with seven different distributions (poisson, zeroinflatedpoisson0, zeroinflatedpoisson1, nbinomial, nbinomial2, zeroinflatednbinomial0, & zeroinflatednbinomial1). The eggs_hotspots function performed the analysis per week with only one distribution, and the eggs_hotspots_week function performed the analysis for all weeks of the year.
 
In addition, the denegg package has complementary functions associated with geostatistical analysis.

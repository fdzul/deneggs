**deneggs is a package developed in the department of prevention and control of diseases transmitted by vector of the [Secretary of Health of Veracruz](https://www.ssaver.gob.mx/) and with colaboration of the [CENAPRECE](https://www.gob.mx/salud/cenaprece)**


## **overview**

**deneggs** is a package to generate predictive maps of the number of eggs or adults in areas where it is not collected.The predictive maps are generated using geostatistical analysis in the [INLA](http://www.r-inla.org/) framework. 

  - **`deneggs::spde_pred_map()`** generate the predictive mapand calculate the hotspots. Run the models with six distributions.
  - **`deneggs::eggs_hotspots()`** generate the predictive map and calculate the hotspots. Run the model with one distribution.
  - **`deneggs::animap_vector_hotblocks()`** generate the animated map of hotblocks of eggs abundance.
  - **`deneggs::ovitraps_read()`** reads current ovitramp databases and historical.
  - **`deneggs::eggs_map()`** generates an entomological risk map or an egg density map.
  - **`deneggs::loc_grid_points()`** It is a complementary function that helps in the creation of grid of the locality in the prediction stack in [INLA](http://www.r-inla.org/).
  - **`mesh()`** It is a complementary function that helps in the creation of mesh.

## Instalation

``` r
# The easiest way to get deneggs is to install:
install.packages("deneggs")
```

### Development version

To get a bug fix, or use a feature from the development version, you can
install deneggs from GitHub.

mac
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fdzul/deneggs")
``` 

linux fedora
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("fdzul/deneggs")
```
### **`deneggs::spde_pred_map()`** return a list with six object:

 - **`data`** is the original dataset of the ovitrap.
 - **`pred`** is the predicction dataset of *the Ae. aegypti* eggs.
 - **`dics`** is a dataframe with the dics of six distribution (poisson, zeroinflatedpoisson0, 1, zeroinflatedpoisson1, nbinomial, nbinomial2, zeroinflatednbinomial0, zeroinflatednbinomial1).
 - **`hotspots`** a dataset with the eggs prediction and the hotspots eggs.
 - **`loc`** is the boundary locality.
 - **`map`** is the map prediction.

## Inspiration

The package was inspired by the need to contribute to making decisions in the dengue prevention and control program, specifically to identify dengue vector hotspots and use the entomological information generated by the program.
